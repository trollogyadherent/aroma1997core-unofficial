Please DO NOT report any issues experienced with this version to Aroma1997. No one wants to listen to bug reports for a "forked" version of a project. Create an issue here.  
Note: the decompiled code had some more and less difficult to fix errors. I don't quite know if everything (looking at inventory tweaks integration) will work as intended. I recommend using this version only if the sole mod depending on aroma1997core is aroma backup.
